    <h2>Musee Roo</h2>
    <h3>📍Bristol, United Kingdom </br></br>💡Historical jewellery for the conscious antiquarian </h3>

      <div class="bio">
      <p><strong> Roo started her business from the dregs of a student overdraft and from her university 
        bedroom in Bristol, whilst studying for a 4-year integrated MArts in History with 
        Innovation at the University of Bristol.</strong> 
      </br></br>
        She finds most of her inspiration in museums, and wants to make many more jewels 
        inspired by original artefacts. Roo has many wax sculptures to get cast, and
        wants to make ancient treasures wearable, and bring them into the everyday.
